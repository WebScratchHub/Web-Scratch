    "title": "1. Introduction to JavaScript",
    "explanation": "JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. You can run JavaScript in the browser's console or within a `<script>` tag in your HTML.",
    "example": "// This is a JavaScript comment\nconsole.log(\"Hello from JavaScript!\");"
  },
  {
    "title": "2. Variables: var, let, and const",
    "explanation": "Variables are containers for storing data. In modern JavaScript, we use `let` for variables that can be reassigned and `const` for variables that should not be reassigned (constants). The older `var` keyword has different scoping rules and is generally avoided.",
    "example": "let age = 25;\nage = 26; // This is allowed\n\nconst name = \"Alice\";\n// name = \"Bob\"; // This would cause an error"
  },
  {
    "title": "3. Data Types",
    "explanation": "JavaScript has several primitive data types: `String` (text), `Number` (for both integers and floats), `Boolean` (true or false), `null` (intentional absence of value), and `undefined` (a variable that has not been assigned a value). It also has complex data types like `Object`.",
    "example": "let greeting = \"Hello\"; // String\nlet score = 100; // Number\nlet isActive = true; // Boolean"
  },
  {
    "title": "4. Functions",
    "explanation": "Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is executed when 'something' invokes it (calls it). Functions are defined with the `function` keyword, or as an arrow function `() => {}`.",
    "example": "function greet(name) {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}\n\nconsole.log(greet(\"Bob\")); // Outputs: Hello, Bob!"
  },
  {
    "title": "5. Arrays",
    "explanation": "Arrays are special variables which can hold more than one value at a time. They are ordered collections, and you can access elements using a zero-based index.",
    "example": "const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"];\nconsole.log(fruits[0]); // Outputs: Apple\n\nfruits.push(\"Orange\"); // Adds an element to the end\nconsole.log(fruits.length); // Outputs: 4"
  },
  {
    "title": "6. Objects",
    "explanation": "Objects are collections of key/value pairs. They are used to store related data and are a fundamental concept in JavaScript. You can access properties using dot notation or bracket notation.",
    "example": "const person = {\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  lastName: \"Doe\",\n  age: 50\n};\n\nconsole.log(person.firstName); // Outputs: John\nconsole.log(person['age']); // Outputs: 50"
  },
  {
    "title": "7. DOM Manipulation",
    "explanation": "The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM, for example, to change the text of an HTML element.",
    "example": "// Assuming you have <p id=\"demo\"></p> in your HTML\nconst paragraph = document.getElementById(\"demo\");\nparagraph.textContent = \"Hello, DOM!\";"
  },
  {
    "title": "8. Event Handling",
    "explanation": "JavaScript can be used to react to user events like clicks, mouse movements, or key presses. You use `addEventListener` to listen for a specific event on an element and then run a function when that event occurs.",
    "example": "// Assuming you have <button id=\"myBtn\">Click me</button>\nconst button = document.getElementById(\"myBtn\");\nbutton.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  alert(\"Button was clicked!\");\n});"
  },
  {
    "title": "9. Conditional Statements",
    "explanation": "Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The primary conditionals are `if`, `else if`, and `else`, which allow you to control the flow of your program.",
    "example": "let time = 14;\n\nif (time < 12) {\n  console.log(\"Good morning!\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Good day!\");\n}"
  },
  {
    "title": "10. Asynchronous JavaScript (Async/Await)",
    "explanation": "JavaScript is single-threaded, but you can perform long network requests or other operations without blocking the main thread using asynchronous code. `async/await` is modern syntax that makes it easier to work with Promises and write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.",
    "example": "async function fetchData() {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n    const data = await response.json();\n    console.log(data);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Fetching data failed:', error);\n  }\n}\n\nfetchData();"
  }
