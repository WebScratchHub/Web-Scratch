    "title": "1. Introduction to PHP",
    "explanation": "PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. It runs on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client.",
    "example": "<?php\n// This is a PHP comment\necho \"Hello, World!\";\n?>"
  },
  {
    "title": "2. Basic Syntax",
    "explanation": "A PHP script is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the browser. A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document. A PHP script starts with `<?php` and ends with `?>`. Statements end with a semicolon.",
    "example": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n\n<h1>My first PHP page</h1>\n\n<?php\necho \"Hello from PHP!\";\n?>\n\n</body>\n</html>"
  },
  {
    "title": "3. Variables",
    "explanation": "In PHP, a variable starts with the `$` sign, followed by the name of the variable. Variable names are case-sensitive. Unlike statically typed languages, you do not need to declare the data type of a variable in advance.",
    "example": "<?php\n$txt = \"Hello world!\";\n$x = 5;\n$y = 10.5;\n\necho $txt;\necho \"<br>\";\necho $x + $y;\n?>"
  },
  {
    "title": "4. echo and print Statements",
    "explanation": "There are two basic ways to get output in PHP: `echo` and `print`. They are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen. `echo` has no return value while `print` has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. `echo` is marginally faster.",
    "example": "<?php\n$name = \"John\";\necho \"<h2>Hello, \" . $name . \"!</h2>\"; // Concatenation with .\n?>"
  },
  {
    "title": "5. PHP Superglobals - $_GET",
    "explanation": "Superglobals are built-in variables that are always available in all scopes. `$_GET` is used to collect data from a form submission with `method=\"get\"` or from data in the URL's query string. It is an associative array of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters.",
    "example": "// URL: index.php?name=Alice&age=30\n\n<?php\necho \"Hello, \" . $_GET['name'] . \"!\";\n?>"
  },
  {
    "title": "6. PHP Superglobals - $_POST",
    "explanation": "`$_POST` is used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form with `method=\"post\"`. `$_POST` is also an associative array. Information sent via POST is not visible in the URL, making it more secure for sensitive data.",
    "example": "<!-- HTML Form -->\n<form action=\"welcome.php\" method=\"post\">\n  Name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\"><br>\n  <input type=\"submit\">\n</form>\n\n<!-- welcome.php -->\n<?php\necho \"Welcome, \" . $_POST['name'] . \"!\";\n?>"
  },
  {
    "title": "7. Conditional Statements (if/else)",
    "explanation": "Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The `if`, `elseif`, and `else` statements allow you to control the flow of your script.",
    "example": "<?php\n$t = date(\"H\");\n\nif ($t < \"12\") {\n    echo \"Have a good morning!\";\n} elseif ($t < \"18\") {\n    echo \"Have a good day!\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Have a good night!\";\n}\n?>"
  },
  {
    "title": "8. Arrays",
    "explanation": "An array stores multiple values in one single variable. PHP supports indexed arrays, associative arrays (with named keys), and multidimensional arrays.",
    "example": "<?php\n// Indexed array\n$cars = array(\"Volvo\", \"BMW\", \"Toyota\");\necho \"I like \" . $cars[0] . \".\";\n\n// Associative array\n$age = array(\"Peter\"=>\"35\", \"Ben\"=>\"37\");\necho \"Peter is \" . $age['Peter'] . \" years old.\";\n?>"
  },
  {
    "title": "9. For Loops",
    "explanation": "Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true. The `for` loop is used when you know in advance how many times the script should run.",
    "example": "<?php\nfor ($x = 0; $x <= 5; $x++) {\n    echo \"The number is: $x <br>\";\n}\n?>"
  },
  {
    "title": "10. Functions",
    "explanation": "A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program. A function will not execute automatically when a page loads. A function will be executed by a call to the function.",
    "example": "<?php\nfunction writeMsg($name) {\n    echo \"Hello, $name!\";\n}\n\nwriteMsg(\"World\"); // call the function\n?>"
  }
